#
# In Python, try/except is commonly used for control flow, and not just for error handling.
#
#
# try
# except
# else
#
#
# The built-in exception classes can be subclassed to define new exceptions; 
# programmers are encouraged to derive new exceptions from the Exception class 
# or one of its subclasses, and not from BaseException.
